### Hi there 👋

I’m a seasoned engineer who loves creating awesome products, crafting polished UI, and stunning UX. I’m a (mostly) self-taught software engineer, who is trying to make the web a better place. Outside of code, I enjoy whiskey🥃, basketball🏀, and anything with plenty of torque🚗.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on IoT products.
